    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone seems to love those crispy, crusty bits of cheese that drip over the edge of a pizza, which is why I've wanted to do a snack video featuring just that for many years. It's usually around the lead up to the Super Bowl, and the associated party snack brainstorming that occurs around that time, when this idea pops up, but for whatever reason I've always chickened out, and gone with something slightly less insane.  </p>
    <p>There's a famous line that resonated with me, delivered by Jeff Goldblum, playing Dr. Ian Malcolm in the movie Jurassic Park, where he says, "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." I always knew I could, and this year, I finally decided I should. And, like in the movie, I'm sure everything will be just fine. Which reminds me, I was in a bar a few months ago, and they had a Triple IPA on the list that was so strong, there was a 2-beer per person limit. That might not be a bad idea here as well.  </p>
    <p>This is not something you want to sit down and eat an entire plate of. But in moderation, I think it would make for a memorable Super Bowl bite. There are no secret tips or tricks here, other than to make sure the cheese gets cooked enough, so that once it cools down, the edges get nice and crisp. And, like I said in the video, go ahead and add whatever other pizza toppings you're into, but no matter what ingredients you use, I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces low-moustre mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
        <li>30 slices pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 13x18-inch, half-sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Grate provolone and mozzarella cheeses with the larger side of a box grater into a large bowl. Use the smaller side and grate in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Toss with your hands to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the cheese mixture into 12 circular piles on the prepared baking sheet, making sure you're getting all three cheeses in each scoop. Top each circle with about Â¾ teaspoon pizza sauce, then place a slice of pepperoni on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until melted and sizzling, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove parchment paper and chips to a wire rack to cool. Line the baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to bake remaining 18 chips.</li>
        <li>Let chips cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the parchment paper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
